									<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										Unsplash is a photo discovery platform for free to use, high-definition photos. We
										(Unsplash Inc., a
										Canadian corporation) operate the Unsplash website at unsplash.com (the “Site”) and
										all
										related
										websites, software, mobile apps, and other services that we provide (together, the
										“Service”) with the
										goal of celebrating and enabling contributors and fostering creativity in our
										community.
										Your use of the
										Service, and our provision of the Service to you, constitutes an agreement by you
										and
										Unsplash to be
										bound by the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service.
									</p>
									<h3>
										2. Eligibility
									</h3>
									<p>
										The Service is designed for use by people who are at least 13 years old. If you are
										not
										yet 13, then you can’t use the Service. If you are 13 or older, you promise to us
										that
										you have never been suspended from the Service, and promise that your use of the
										Service
										won’t break any laws or regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of a
										company, organization, or other kind of entity, you represent to us that you have
										authority to bind the organization to these Terms on its behalf.
									</p>
									<h4>
										4. Limited License to Use the Service (but not the Photos)
									</h4>

									<p>
										Conditioned on your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you permission to
										access the Service only for your personal use.
									</p>

									<h3>
										5. License to Photos
									</h3>

									<p>
										One of the best features of the Service permits you to search, view, and download
										photographs that have been uploaded by Unsplash users (“Photos”). You may download and
										use Photos from the Service in accordance with, and subject to, the Unsplash License. We
										encourage you to familiarize yourself with the Unsplash License, as well as the
										accompanying FAQs. To be sure you don’t miss it, here’s the crux of the license:
									</p>

									<p>
										Unsplash grants you an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to
										download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from Unsplash for free,
										including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the
										photographer or Unsplash, but this license does not include the right to compile photos
										from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service.
									</p>

									<p>
										This means that Photos on the Service come with a very, very broad copyright license
										under the Unsplash License. This is why we say that they are “Free to Use.” Note that
										the Unsplash License does not include the right to use:
									</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Trademarks, logos, or brands that appear in Photos</li>
										<li>People’s images if they are recognizable in the Photos</li>
										<li>Works of art or authorship that appear in Photos</li>
									</ul>

									<p>
										If you download photos with any of these depicted in them, you may need the permission
										of the brand owner of the brand or work of authorship or individual depending on how you
										use the Photo. Please see our FAQs for more information and, if you still aren’t sure,
										you should probably talk to a lawyer who knows about these things.
